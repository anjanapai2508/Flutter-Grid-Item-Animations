2. Use CustomClipper to have rounded borders around the grid items.
3. Use InkWell to detect when the user hovers over an item.
4. Use CustomClipper to convert top-right round border into an arc when hovered over.
5. Show a circle shaped container on top-left when hovered over.
6. Show an opaque overlay with text when hovered over.
